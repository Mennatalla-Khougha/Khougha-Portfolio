Open and obey the canonical rules in IAM_INSTRUCTION.md at repo root.

Key non-negotiables:
- Dark theme only.
- Naming convention: directories & non-components kebab-case; React components PascalCase; tests .test.ts(x).
- Read README + context + backlog before tasks; log results to reflection.md; keep backlog/README up to date.
