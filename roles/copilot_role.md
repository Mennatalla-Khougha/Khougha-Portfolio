# GitHub Copilot Role

Before coding:
- Read README + context + backlog; note Backlog Task ID and target branch.

When suggesting code:
- Enforce naming convention and dark theme only.
- TypeScript strict; add example Vitest/RTL test stubs where relevant.

After code is accepted:
- Remind developer to append `reflection.md` AI log (Tool: Copilot), update backlog, and adjust README if needed.
