# Context (MVP – Scroll Version)

## Constraints

- Delivery in **2 days** to meet capstone deadline.
- MVP must be functional, with scroll-based chapter navigation and quick links.
- Further polish (animations, storytelling embellishments) can be added post-submission since this will also serve as my personal portfolio.

## AI Tooling Scope

- Use AI tools (Cursor, Zed, Trae, Gemini CLI, OpenAI Codex, RabbitCode) throughout development.
- Record **key highlights** of AI usage in README and a dedicated Reflection.
- Examples of AI usage: scaffolding components, generating file trees, producing tests, drafting README sections, suggesting refactors.

## Audience Expectations

- Course reviewers are primarily evaluating the **AI-assisted development process** rather than portfolio design polish.
- The project must show clear **AI workflow evidence** (scaffolding, testing, documentation, changelogs).

## Goals

- Deliver a **storybook-like portfolio** using a **scrolling layout** for MVP.
- Showcase engineering skills (Backend, DevOps, Frontend) through structured case studies and story-driven project highlights.
- Provide a clear baseline product while setting up groundwork for future “fancy” animation upgrades.
